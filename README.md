# Bank Fraud Detection and Reconciliation

## Overview

This project demonstrates a data-driven solution for automated bank ledger reconciliation and fraud detection at Aristova Private Bank, Chandigarh. Our team, BrandStormers, created a Python-powered workflow and interactive Power BI dashboards to fix manual ledger matching inefficiencies, enable rapid fraud detection, and provide actionable business insights.

## Introduction

Aristova Bank processes thousands of daily transactions across a Master Ledger and Simulated Ledger. Manual reconciliation led to missed records, errors, slow fraud identification, and increased operational burden. The project automates matching, ensures ledger accuracy, enables timely fraud investigation, and supports compliance.

---

## Project Scope & Achievements

- Automated ledger reconciliation and fraud flagging (Python)
- Matched, missing, and mismatched transaction classification
- Power BI dashboards for reconciliation summary and fraud analysis
- Recommendations for management and tech teams
- Data filtering and interactive analytics for stakeholders

---

## Background & Gaps

Manual reconciliation is slow, not scalable, and lacks real-time fraud alerts. Commercial solutions rarely integrate fraud detection with reconciliation. This project solves:
- Integration of reconciliation and fraud detection
- Real-time visibility using open-source stack
- Actionable intelligence with dashboards
- Reduced manual effort and improved cost efficiency

---

## Objectives

- Automate ledger reconciliation and detect fraud (Python)
- Integrate fraud flags in transaction matching logic
- Power BI dashboards for dynamic key metrics
- Improve data integrity, efficiency, and accessibility
- Support compliance and reporting requirements

---

## System Design

**Tools Used:**
- Excel (initial analysis, documentation)
- Python (core logic for reconciliation & fraud)
- Power BI (interactive dashboards for KPIs)
- Draw.io (process flows and system diagrams)

**Workflow Highlights:**
- Activity/sequence diagrams for system operations
- Automated alerts for high-risk or anomalous transactions

---

## Methodology

1. Collect and preprocess dataset
2. Simulate secondary ledger from master records
3. Apply reconciliation rules for transaction matching
4. Identify KPIs and fraudulent transactions
5. Analyze fraud patterns & technical inaccuracies
6. Recommend improvements for managers and developers

---

## Results & Analysis

- Achieved >98% ledger match rate (Power BI visualization)
- Device-wise and city fraud breakdowns for risk detection
- Transaction type analysis: ATM, Desktop, POS, Mobile channels
- Time series for daily fraud/reconciliation trends
- Data-driven discrepancy analysis for risk mitigation

---

## Key Takeaways

- Python plus Power BI address gaps left by basic tools
- Business analysts are critical for process improvement
- Automated dashboards speed detection and improve accuracy
